Allows users to setup an avatar image, which can appear in their posts
and profile page. Users can upload multiple avatar images in the
control center. One of these can be selected as the active avatar.

For running this mod, you need Phorum 5.2.0 or later. It will not
work for earlier versions of Phorum.

2. Installation:
----------------

  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "User Avatar".

- Configure the module to your likings through the module's settings page.

- Templates must be configured to show avatars. Suggested template changes
  are included in the "3. Main template customization" section below.
  Alter your template to suit your needs and taste.


3. Main template customization:
-------------------------------

To display the avatar on various Phorum pages, you will have to edit the
Phorum template files. Here is a description of the files and the
template variables that you can use and some some sample implementations.

* read.tpl (flat read mode)
* read_hybrid.tpl (hybrid read mode)

    Inside the message loop {LOOP MESSAGES}, you can use the template
    variable {MESSAGES->user_avatar} for the avatar image URL.
    You can check that same variable, to see if the author has an avatar
    enabled or not.

    The most basic code for showing the avatar image is:

        {IF MESSAGES->user_avatar}
          <img src="{MESSAGES->user_avatar}" alt="avatar" />
        {/IF}

    For avatars that are added using module version 3.0.2 and higher, two
    extra template variables are available (if no dimensions are available,
    then both will be zero):

        {MESSAGES->user_avatar_w} : Image width in pixels
        {MESSAGES->user_avatar_h} : Image height in pixels

    You can use these to assign appropriate width and height stylesheet
    parameters to to the image.

    In the emerald template, you could for example incorporate the code like
    below, to make it show up to the left of the user details
    (IP, registration, posts). The added code is shown inside the box.

      ......
      ......
           {MESSAGES->datestamp}
           </small>
       </td>
      _____________________________________________________________
     |                                                             |
       <td style="padding-right:10px">
         {IF MESSAGES->user_avatar}
           <img src="{MESSAGES->user_avatar}" alt="avatar"
            {IF MESSAGES->user_avatar_w}
              style="width:{MESSAGES->user_avatar_w}px;
                     height:{MESSAGES->user_avatar_h}px"
            {/IF} />
         {/IF}
       </td>
     |_____________________________________________________________|

       <td class="message-user-info" nowrap="nowrap">
           {IF MESSAGES->user->admin}
               <strong>{LANG->Admin}</strong><br />
      ......
      ......


* read_threads.tpl (threaded read mode)

    You can use the template variable {MESSAGE->user_avatar} for the
    avatar image URL for the message that is being viewed. You can check
    that same variable, to see if the author has an avatar enabled or not.

    Note: beware of the difference in the template variable, compared to the
    other read templates above. This one uses "MESSAGE", where the ones above
    uses "MESSAGES".

    The most basic code for showing the avatar image is:

        {IF MESSAGE->user_avatar}
          <img src="{MESSAGE->user_avatar}" alt="" />
        {/IF}

    For avatars that are added using module version 3.0.2 and higher, two
    extra template variables are available (if no dimensions are available,
    then both will be zero):

        {MESSAGE->user_avatar_w} : Image width in pixels
        {MESSAGE->user_avatar_h} : Image height in pixels

    In the emerald template, you can use the same kind of code that was used
    for the flat and hybrid view above, to make it show up to the left of the
    user details (IP, registration, posts). Just make sure that you use
    "MESSAGE" instead of "MESSAGES".


* profile.tpl (if you want the user's avatar to appear in the profile page)

    You can use the template variable {PROFILE->user_avatar} for the
    avatar image URL for the profile that is being viewed. You can check
    that same variable, to see if the user has an avatar enabled or not.

    The most basic code for showing the avatar image on the profile page is:

        {IF PROFILE->user_avatar}
          <img src="{PROFILE->user_avatar}" alt="" />
        {/IF}

    For avatars that are added using module version 3.0.2 and higher, two
    extra template variables are available (if no dimensions are available,
    then both will be zero):

        {PROFILE->user_avatar_w} : Image width in pixels
        {PROFILE->user_avatar_h} : Image height in pixels

    In the emerald template, you could for example incorporate the code like
    below, to make it show up in the top right corner of the profile info.
    The added code is shown inside the box.

      ......
      ......
      <div id="profile">

          <div class="generic">
             _________________________________________________________
            |                                                         |
              {IF PROFILE->user_avatar}
                <img src="{PROFILE->user_avatar}" alt="avatar"
                 {IF PROFILE->user_avatar_w}
                   style="width:{PROFILE->user_avatar_w}px;
                          height:{PROFILE->user_avatar_h}px"
                 {/IF} align="right" />
              {/IF}
            |_________________________________________________________|

              {IF PROFILE->user_avatar}
                <img src="{PROFILE->user_avatar}" alt="" align="right"/>
              {/IF}

              <div class="icon-user">
      ......
      ......

* <any template>.tpl

    You can use the template variable {USER->user_avatar} for the
    avatar image URL for the currently logged in Phorum user.
    You can check that same variable, to see if the user has an avatar
    enabled or not.

    Two extra template variables are available (if no dimensions are
    available, then both will be zero):

        {PROFILE->user_avatar_w} : Image width in pixels
        {PROFILE->user_avatar_h} : Image height in pixels

    These template variables are available on any page. You can use
    template code like the code from the above examples to display
    the user's avatar wherever you like.


4. Module template customization:
---------------------------------

By default, this module will use the template files from the directory
"templates/emerald" for displaying an extra menu option in the control
center (cc_menu_item.tpl) and for displaying the control center panel
where the user can manage the avatar settings (cc_panel.tpl).

If you want to modify the templates to make them work better for your
site's template, then do not edit the template files that were in
the module distribution. Instead, copy the full directory

  mods/user_avatar/templates/emerald
  
to

  mods/user_avatar/templates/yourtemplatename
  
(asuming that your site's template is stored as "templates/yourtemplatename")
and edit the files in the new directory. Phorum will automatically recognize
that you have created a specific template set to use for your site's active
template.

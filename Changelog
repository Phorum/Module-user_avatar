2011-04-01 3.1.2 Maurice Makaay

    - Implemented a performance enhancement. Instead of retrieving user
      info for message authors separately, the code that applies avatars to
      a list of messages now bundles all involved users and retrieves
      their info in a single request.

    - Updated the "ChangesSaved" confirmation to use the "ProfileUpdatedOk"
      message, which is used by other parts of the control center too.

    - New global template variables added:
      - {LANG->mod_user_avatar->CCConfigureAvatar}
      - {URL->CC_AVATAR}

    - The default avatar is now applied to anonymous users too.

2011-01-13 3.1.1 Maurice Makaay

    - The user avatar is now available for the posting editor as well
      in the template variable {POSTING->MOD_USER_AVATAR}.
      For most editing scenarios, the avatar of the active user 
      {USER->MOD_USER_AVATAR} could be used. However, when editing a message 
      as a moderator, this would not deliver the correct avatar when editing
      another user's post.

2010-10-13 3.1.0 Maurice Makaay

    - Template variables were changed to get rid of some collisions
      between configuration storage and template variables. Please check
      the README for information about the new template variables and
      update your existing template accordingly.

    - Some language strings were added to the module. If you are using
      a bundled language file, then please check if the translation is
      complete. If not, then you will find some English strings in
      lang/yourlanguage.php. If you create a translation, then please
      post it in this module's thread at phorum.org, so we can include
      the translation in the distribution package.

    - The module now sets up avatar images for the list page as well.
      The template variables are exactly the same as those that are
      set up for the read page.

    - Images can now be uploaded by providing the image URL. The server
      will download the image via HTTP. The retrieved file is used for
      setting up the avatar.

    - When the image is smaller than or close to the required size for an
      avatar, then it will be scaled to the correct size and saved.

    - When the uploaded image is too big to be used as an avatar, then the
      module will now present an image cropping and scaling interface to
      the user, where the user can easily select a portion of the uploaded
      image to be used as the avatar.

    - Support for Gravatar was added, to make Gravatar integrate
      seamlessly with this module.

    - When no avatar is selected, but avatars are available for the user,
      then module will now automatically select and enable the first
      available avatar when entering the control center avatar page.

    - Configuration options were added, to make it possible for the admin
      to select any or all of the avatar methods (file upload, url upload
      and gravatar).

    - A configuration option was added to configure a default avatar image.
      This image will be used in case the user did not setup an avatar for
      his account.

    - Because the module is by now a full rewrite of the original code by
      Chris Eaton and CZVilda, I removed them from the author list in
      the README.

2009-05-24 3.0.5 Maurice Makaay

    - Made the module compatible with API changes in Phorum 5.3.

2008-11-14 3.0.4 Maurice Makaay

    - Generate the avatar for the currently active user as well. The
      avatar is available in {USER->user_avatar}.

    - For all template variables, the names have changed from

      {DATA->mod_user_avatar}   -> {DATA->user_avatar}
      {DATA->mod_user_avatar_w} -> {DATA->user_avatar_w}
      {DATA->mod_user_avatar_h} -> {DATA->user_avatar_h}

      The template variables that were used up to version 3.0.3
      have all been implemented as backward compabibility options,
      so no changes are needed in the templates. The new
      {USER->user_avatar} is only available under that name.

2008-07-01 3.0.3 Maurice Makaay

    - Fixed an undefined index warning.
      Thanks to Oliver Riesen for noticing.

2008-01-08 3.0.2 Maurice Makaay

    - The image dimensions (width and height) for avatar images are
      now stored in the user avatar data. Extra template variables
      {OBJECT->mod_user_avatar_w} and {OBJECT->mod_user_avatar_h}
      have been introduced to make this information available from the
      templates. This can be used to assign a correct width and height
      to avatar images. See the README for updated template examples.

      The idea for this was provided by Phorum user "tomierna". He also
      provided a patch, but that one had to retrieve the image data for
      the avatars on each request to determine the filesize. Since we
      already have the dimensions available, right after the avatar file
      upload, I figured we could better remember that data from there
      to make this a really lightweight option.

2007-11-01 3.0.1 Maurice Makaay

      Thanks to user "born2die" at phorum.org.

    - Added German language files.
      Thanks to user "Berti" at phorum.org.

    - Added French language file.
      Thanks to notre-planete.info.

    - Added Turkish language file.
      Thanks to user "scabboy" at phorum.org.

    - Added Italian language file.
      Thanks to Nicola.

2007-09-14 3.0.0 Maurice Makaay

    - Fixed an undefined index warning.

    - First stable release for Phorum 5.2.

2007-09-12 2.99.10 Maurice Makaay

    - Fixed some undefined index warnings.
      Long live Phorum Event Logging! :-)

    - Fixed a problem which could show up as a broken image on the
      user profile page.

2007-09-09 2.99.9 Maurice Makaay

    - Added missing language key "SelectAvatar" to the language files.

    - Drastically simplified the template to not show info that is not
      really needed for the avatar functionality.

    - Added a new template var NUMBER_OF_FILES, which can be used to
      hide the list of avatar files if none are uploaded.

    - Added a new permission setting, which determines what users can
      disable displaying of avatars.

    - Added template variables for representing the avatar permissions:
      {PERMISSION->AVATAR_CREATE} and {PERMISSION->AVATAR_DISABLE}

2007-09-09 2.99.8 Maurice Makaay

    - Added some permission settings to the module. It's now possible to
      allow avatars to one of all users, moderators+admins or admins.
      In case "moderators+admins" is chosen, it's additionally possible to
      only have the avatar displayed in messages that are in a forum for
      which the user really has message moderation access.

2007-09-06 2.99.7 Maurice Makaay

    - Added on-the-fly upgrading of avatars for older versions of this
      module.

2007-09-05 2.99.6 Maurice Makaay

    - Fixed a bug in the message processing cache code.
      Thanks to CBiLL for reporting.

    - Added functionality to cleanup a user's avatar files if the
      user is deleted.

2007-09-04 2.99.5 Maurice Makaay

    - Made use of a new feature in the Phorum file API, to link files
      to a module. That way, it's no longer needed to have file
      uploads enabled. The module now takes care of its own
      file storage.

2007-09-04 2.99.4 Maurice Makaay

    - The profile hook did not check for avatar = -1.

    - Did some optimizations on the code that adds avatar info to
      the messages.

    - Updated the language file. I misunderstood the disable functionality
      for the avatars. It is not to disable your own avatar, but it is
      to fully disable showing avatars in postings.

    - settings.php now makes use of the defaults.php file to fill in
      some default values.

2007-09-03 2.99.3 Maurice Makaay

    - Added a Dutch translation for the module.

    - Added a require_version to the module's info.txt.

    - Added a "ChangesSaved" confirmation after successfully saving
      the user settings for the mod.

    - Reformatted the language file and added a new string for
      the menu item in the control center. Also, removed stale
      keys from the language file.

    - Changed the module to make use of a new hook (cc_panel) in the
      core code, which takes away the need to copy files into the main
      Phorum file tree. Additionally, moved the control panel template
      to a module template, so that one doesn't need copying anymore
      as well.

    - Changed the menu item for the control center in a template, so
      it can be adjusted for other templates.

    - Renamed mod_user_install_common() -> mod_user_avatar_common().

    - Use phorum_admin_okmsg() in the settings.php script.

    - Renamed readme.txt to README for Phorum module admin interface
      compliance.

    - Formatted the README for 80 column screens and extended the
      information in this file.

    - Got rid of deprecated =& assignment for new object in settings.php.

2007-09-02 2.99.2 Thomas Seifert

    - Initial development release.
